Pixel
=====

A simple pixel art editor written in Swift.

###About the current version
Currently this editor is extremely basic. You can not yet change the size of the canvas, zoom-in or out (it's set to 1000% currently) and you can only paint in one colour. However this is basically the
foundation work that is being laid for a tool that will be used by myself for [QuantumCarrot](http://quantumcarrot.com) in the future.

Current/Planned features of the editor are:

- Colours (Obviously)
- Brush/Pen Sizes
- Shapes (Lines, Rectangles, Ovals, etc)
- Flood Filling
- Layers (Pretty much in - can not name or toggle layer visibility yet)
- Custom Canvas sizes
- Pixel file format to allow for layers to be saved
- Export to PNG, JPG, etc
- Layer Blending


###Why?
In all honesty, I've wanted an excuse to play around with Swift in a none game project, and decided a Pixel Art Editor would be pretty fun and useful to make.
